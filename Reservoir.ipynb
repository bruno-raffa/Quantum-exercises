        "Water reservoir levels must be carefully controlled to satisfy consumer demand while maintaining minimum water levels. To satisfy this demand and maintain at least a minimum level of water in the reservoir, pumps can be operated to provide water flow into the reservoir. To operate these pumps there is a cost, and we would like to choose which pumps to use throughout the day in order to minimize cost.\n",

        "The challenge is coped on D-wave using a BQM. In this notebook instead the problem **was solved using a CQM**. The results obtained with this model show a **better performance **(in terms of minor operating cost of the pumps), if compared with the BQM used by the authors."
